Facebook is a NLP based search engine which process natural language like "english" ! and tokenize words and try to gather relevant information because of this nature facebook search queries are like a game .

For example, if you’re interested in finding someone who works at a certain company, lives in a certain city, and likes a certain type of food, you might use the following query:

“People who work at Starbucks and live in Dallas, Texas and like Mexican food”

When you understand how queries can be structured, it’s easier to determine what type of query will yield your desired result.

Lucky for you, Graph Search can handle a surprising number of criteria. Here are some people-focused queries to experiment with.

“People named [name] who like [something]”

“People named [name] who like [something] and work at [company]”

“People named [name] who like [something] and live in [city, state]

“Fans of [page] who visited [city, state]”

You can also take a more general approach to a people-focused search. For example, you might search for something like:

“People who live in [city, state] and are [single/married] and like [something]”

“[women/men] who work at [company] and live in [city, state] and like [page]”

There are currently 1.49 billion active Facebook users, so trying to find someone named Paul, for example, is like finding a needle in a haystack factory. Needless to say, the more information you have on someone, the better.

this little tool will make it easy for you to fetch information about any person,friends without actually using graph api 
+ you don't need to type entire queries just type the person name and the queries will be ready related to the person well the real pain is of clicking !
